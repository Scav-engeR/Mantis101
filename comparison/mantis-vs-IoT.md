# Mantis vs. Traditional IoT Botnets: Comparative Analysis

## Introduction

The evolution of DDoS attack infrastructure has seen a significant paradigm shift with the emergence of VM-based botnets like Mantis. This document provides a detailed comparison between the traditional IoT-based botnet model (exemplified by Mirai and its variants) and the newer VM-based model represented by Mantis. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing effective defensive strategies against next-generation DDoS threats.

## Case Study: Attack Comparison

### Mirai Botnet Attack (2016)

* **Size**: Estimated 600,000 compromised devices
* **Target**: Dyn DNS service
* **Method**: UDP DNS flood
* **Impact**: Major internet platforms unavailable for hours
* **Mitigation**: Primarily through traffic filtering and blocking

### Mantis Botnet Attack (2022-2025)

* **Size**: Approximately 5,000 compromised VMs
* **Target**: Multiple high-profile organizations across various sectors
* **Method**: HTTPS floods, application layer attacks
* **Impact**: Service degradation despite DDoS protection
* **Mitigation**: Required sophisticated application-layer defenses and behavioral analysis

## Conclusion

The evolution from IoT-based to VM-based botnets represents a significant paradigm shift in the DDoS threat landscape. While traditional botnets rely on the sheer number of compromised devices, Mantis demonstrates that a much smaller number of more powerful computing resources can deliver substantially more impact with greater sophistication.

This fundamental architectural change requires security professionals to reevaluate defense strategies. Organizations must adapt by implementing cloud-specific security controls, advanced application layer inspection capabilities, and behavior-based anomaly detection systems.

The effectiveness of Mantis with a relatively small number of bots suggests that future DDoS attacks will continue to evolve toward higher sophistication rather than simply larger scale. Security strategies must therefore evolve beyond traditional volumetric defense approaches to address this new generation of threats.
