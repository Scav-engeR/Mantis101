By: **Scav-engeR**

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research and analysis on the Mantis botnet, one of the most advanced DDoS threats in the current cybersecurity landscape. Unlike traditional IoT-based botnets that rely on massive numbers of compromised devices, Mantis represents a new generation of VM-based botnets that leverage fewer but much more powerful computing resources for devastating attacks.

## Key Findings

- **Unprecedented Efficiency**: Mantis generates 26 million HTTPS requests per second using only ~5,000 VMs (5,200 RPS per bot)
- **Architectural Innovation**: Uses compromised virtual machines and servers instead of IoT devices
- **Advanced Attack Vectors**: Specializes in HTTPS DDoS attacks requiring complete TLS handshakes
- **Strategic Targeting**: Primarily focused on Internet & Telecom (36%), News & Media (15%), and Gaming (12%) industries

## Repository Contents

- **[analysis/](./analysis/)**: Interactive visualizations and deep-dive analysis of Mantis architecture
- **[comparison/](./comparison/)**: Technical comparison between Mantis and traditional IoT botnets
- **[diagrams/](./diagrams/)**: Visual representations of Mantis attack flows and infection methods
- **[mitigations/](./mitigations/)**: Defensive strategies and countermeasures against VM-based botnets

## Infection Methods

Mantis differs significantly from traditional botnets in its infection approach:

1. **Target Selection**: Strategic focus on high-bandwidth servers and VMs with minimal security
2. **Compromise Techniques**:
   - Exploits VM vulnerabilities in hypervisors and cloud management interfaces
   - Uses credential compromise against cloud consoles and SSH/RDP
   - Leverages supply chain attacks against VM templates and images
3. **Post-Compromise**: Sophisticated persistence mechanisms survive reboots and security scans

## Attack Vectors

The Mantis botnet employs several sophisticated attack methodologies:

- **HTTPS Floods**: Complete TLS handshakes consuming significant server resources
- **TCP Reflection/Amplification**: Leverages middleboxes for traffic amplification
- **Application Layer Attacks**: Targets resource-intensive functions of web applications
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting Evasion**: Modulates traffic patterns to avoid detection

## Statistics & Impact

- Records show attacks against nearly 1,000 targets in a 30-day period
- Geographical targeting shows concentration on US (20%) and Russian (15%) organizations
- Attack durations are typically short (30-80 seconds) but extremely intensive
- Mantis has consistently demonstrated the ability to overwhelm sophisticated DDoS protections

## Defensive Considerations

Defending against Mantis-like botnets requires:

- Advanced application-layer inspection capabilities
- TLS traffic analysis and behavioral monitoring
- Cloud infrastructure security hardening
- VM template security and strong access controls
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
