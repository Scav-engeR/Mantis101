# Mantis Botnet: Technical Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The Mantis botnet represents a significant evolution in DDoS infrastructure, employing a fundamentally different architecture than traditional botnets. First identified in 2022 and still active in 2025, Mantis has demonstrated unprecedented attack capabilities by leveraging a relatively small network of compromised virtual machines and servers rather than massive arrays of IoT devices. This technical analysis explores Mantis's architecture, infection methodologies, attack vectors, and strategic implications for cybersecurity professionals.

## 1. Architectural Overview

Unlike traditional IoT-based botnets that rely on tens or hundreds of thousands of low-powered devices, Mantis utilizes approximately 5,000 high-powered virtual machines and servers. This architectural shift provides several critical advantages:

- **HTTP Proxy Layer**: A network of HTTP proxies that help disguise attack traffic
- **Attack Orchestration System**: Sophisticated coordination system allowing for precise timing and distribution of attacks

### 1.2 Computational Power

Each Mantis bot provides substantially more computational resources than traditional IoT bots:

- **Processing Capacity**: Enterprise-grade CPUs with multi-core capabilities
- **Memory Resources**: Sufficient RAM to handle complex operations including TLS processing
- **Network Bandwidth**: High-speed data center connections with minimal limitations
- **Persistence**: Server-class reliability with near-constant uptime
